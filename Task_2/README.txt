Project - "Image difference detection using Opencv"

Objective - Code takes two images as input and display the difference between images with an output image and also calculates the 
similarity score between the input images.

Notes - 

1- Code uses simple opencv techniques to detect the pixel changes in two input images
and create bounding boxes around the differneces.
2- Please note that the input images should be of same size for the program to give result correctly.
3- Filepath should be changed accordingly for new images.
